to get automat scipts using automat.py, you just have to update the input files in line 8 and 11. Then just run the scripts, it will ask
the input month to the user and will give the output scipts.
We need two input files from user in excel format, one is the dump data excel sheet for any month and other is the mapping data for DU and DUOps in excel sheet.
